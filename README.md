libcrosvm is a librarification of crosvm. It is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) based on Linux‚Äôs KVM hypervisor, with a focus on simplicity, security, and speed. libcrosvm is intended to run Linux guests, originally as a security boundary for running native applications on the ChromeOS platform. Compared to QEMU, libcrosvm doesn‚Äôt emulate architectures or real hardware, instead concentrating on paravirtualized devices, such as the virtio standard.
