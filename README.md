## [libcrosvm](libcrosvm)

libcrosvm is a bastardized librarification of crosvm. It is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) based on Linux’s KVM hypervisor, with a focus on simplicity, security, and speed. libcrosvm is intended to run Linux guests, originally as a security boundary for running native applications on the ChromeOS platform. Compared to QEMU, libcrosvm doesn’t emulate architectures or real hardware, instead concentrating on paravirtualized devices, such as the virtio standard.
