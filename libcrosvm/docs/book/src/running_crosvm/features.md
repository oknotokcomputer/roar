# Features

[Feature flags] of the `crosvm` crate control which features are included in the binary. These
features can be enabled using Cargo's `--features` flag. Some features are enabled by default unless
the Cargo `--no-default-features` flag is specified. See the `crosvm` crate documentation for
details.
