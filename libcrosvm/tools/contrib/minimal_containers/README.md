# Minimal Containers

These containers simulate a fresh developer workstation and can be used to test out-of-the box
development workflows for crosvm.

To run one of the containers:

```
./run.sh Dockerfile.ubuntu
```

Or to run `cargo build` in all containers run:

```
./test-all.sh
```

Note: These scripts are experimental and not validated in CI.
